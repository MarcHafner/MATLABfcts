function m = infmean(x,dim)
%INFMEAN Mean value, ignoring Infs.
%   M = INFMEAN(X) returns the sample mean of X, treating Infs as missing
%   values.  For vector input, M is the mean value of the non-Inf elements
%   in X.  For matrix input, M is a row vector containing the mean value of
%   non-Inf elements in each column.  For N-D arrays, INFMEAN operates
%   along the first non-singleton dimension.
%
%   INFMEAN(X,DIM) takes the mean along dimension DIM of X.
%
%   See also MEAN, INFMEDIAN, INFSTD, INFVAR, INFMIN, INFMAX, INFSUM.
