MATLABfcts
==========
These are functions for MATLAB. They are divided in multiple folders:
* src contains the functions. It has multiple folders:
  - small_helpers: small functions that complement or copy some of common MATLAB functions
  - plotting_fcts: functions that are related to figures and plotting in general
  - calculations:  functions for mathematical evaluations
  - DB_helpers:    functions to work with database
  - DrugResponseSuite: function related to the drug treatment pipeline with the D300 and Columbus
  - plotting_fcts: functions for plots and figures
  - SingleCellFitting:   functions related to the TRAIL project

  - dev; In_work: functions currently being developed; no guarantee.
  
* test_fct contains scripts to test the functions from src
